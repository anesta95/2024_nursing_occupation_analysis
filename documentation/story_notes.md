## Research Questions

### How prevalent is the nursing occupation?

According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Nursing is the sixth largest specific occupation in the current U.S. workforce. In terms of occupations in healthcare, nursing is the second largest in the nation behind home health and personal care aides which as of 2023 was the most common occupation in the country.

Nursing is also unique in that it's one of the few occupations that's both prevalent *and* high paying, with a median annual wage last year of $86,070, it was one of only three occupations with over 2 million workers that a median annual wage over the $4X,XXX national median. Only general and operations managers had a higher average yearly salary at $101,280.

### What has the trend been in size and wages of the nursing workforce?

Nursing is also a growing occupation, as data from the BLS show that RN employment has grown 20.6% from 2012 to 2023. This growth closely mirrors the overall growth in general healthcare professions and is about four percentage points higher than overall job growth during that same period.

Data show that wage hikes for nurses haven't quite kept pace with the increase of earnings in the overall workforce. However, this is mainly due to substantial pay growth for lower-earning professions during the last three years rather than any decline for nurses as median annual earnings for the profession are still up 31.5% over the last 11 years.

The job growth that the nursing field has seen over the past decade isn't expected to slow down. In face, according to projections data from the BLS, RNs are set to have the fifth largest raw number of new jobs open up between 2022 and 2032, with it's 177,400 future roles behind only stockers and order fillers, restaurant cooks, software developers, and home health and personal care aides.

On top of that the nursing occupation has the second highest median annual wage and projected new open positions of any career that is reported to need no work experience in a related occupation or on-the-job training. Only software developers are projected to have more openings and have a higher median annual salary.
